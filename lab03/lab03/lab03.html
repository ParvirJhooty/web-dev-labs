        Conclusion
    </h2>

    <h4>
        Both fluid grids and Bootstrap are popular tools in the web development field, each offering advantages to web developers. Fluid grids are a fundamental component for ensuring a website's responsiveness, ensuring it appears properly on various devices. On the other hand, Bootstrap is a robust front-end framework that simplifies the development process. Having used both tools, I've found that fluid grids provide more customization options for a website, whereas Bootstrap offers a quicker and more straightforward way to customize websites. After creating websites with both tools, I realized that Bootstrap is more user-friendly and manageable. Since the focus of the project was to create a responsive website without delving into extensive coding, Bootstrap proved to be the easier choice. Not only that, but it took me less time to learn how to utilize the Bootstrap framework compared to mastering fluid grids. Fluid grids can be challenging due to the necessity for extensive adjustments to accommodate various screen sizes and devices, making the design process more intricate. In conclusion, if I were to create my personal website, I would prefer to use Bootstrap because it eliminates the concern of how the website will appear on different devices.
