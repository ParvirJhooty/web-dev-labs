                <h2 id="family">Family and Upbringing</h2>
                <p>I grew up in a family of 7 in the Toronto neighborhood of Rexdale, alongside my 2 older sisters, both parents, and both grandparents.
                    My parents and grandparents had immigrated to Vancouver, Canada in the 1980s, eventually making there way to Toronto right before having my sister.
                    At the age of 12, we had then moved to Brampton, which is where I spent some of middle school and all of high school. We now currently reside in Vaughan, without my oldest sister as she in now married.

                <div>The most common places I have traveled to in my life would be Vancouver and India. However in the past few years I've embarked on new journeys
                    such as Miami, New York, Alberta (Banff), and my favourite being Croatia! Some of my dream destinations include Japan, Iceland, and Switzerland.
